**Project Title: COVID-19 Global Data Exploratory Analysis**

**Description:**

This project aims to perform an exploratory data analysis (EDA) on global COVID-19 data to uncover key insights into the spread and impact of the pandemic. Using data provided by the Johns Hopkins University, this analysis focuses on understanding the trends, patterns, and regional differences in confirmed COVID-19 cases over time. The project includes data cleaning, transformation, and visualization to highlight the most affected regions, the progression of cases globally, and comparisons between countries.

Key objectives:
- Analyze the evolution of COVID-19 cases worldwide.
- Identify countries and regions with the highest case numbers.
- Visualize trends in confirmed cases over time.

This project was developed using R and leverages libraries such as `tidyverse`, `dplyr`, and `ggplot2` for data manipulation and visualization.

**Technologies Used:**
- R
- tidyverse
- ggplot2
- dplyr

The results are presented through various plots, including line graphs, bar charts, and summaries, providing a clear picture of the pandemic's progression across different countries.
